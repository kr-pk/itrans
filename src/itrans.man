       Note:  be  sure  to  consult  the user manual idoc.itx and
       other *.itx files as needed, from the doc/ directory. They
       contain  more information on the input ITRANS accepts, and
       the languages supported, and all the transliteration maps.

       The command

                      itrans < idoc.itx > idoc.tex

       takes  the input file idoc.itx and copies it to the output
       file idoc.tex, after modifying all portions in  the  input
       designated as transliterated indian language text.

       iittrraannss  looks  for the  indian language metric file in the
       standard places, as defined by  the  environment  variable
       ITRANSPATH.   Set  this variable to the path name(s) where
       the  files  dvnc.ifm,  dvng.ifm,  devnac.afm,   devnac.ps,
       itrans.pro,  etc are to be found (multiple directory names
       are separated by the letter ":" --- similar  to  the  PATH
       environment variable).  ITRANSPATH should also contain the
       directories that store all the *.tfm and *.afm  files:  If
       you  are  using  the tamil font, ITRANSPATH should contain
       the name of the directory that wntml10.tfm resides in.  If
       you  are  using the telugu font, ITRANSPATH should contain
       the name of the directory that tel10.tfm resides  in.   If
       you  are  using  the  devanagari PostScript font (Devnac),
       ITRANSPATH should contain the name of the  directory  that
       devnac.afm  resides  in.   If you are using the devanagari
       Metafont font (Devnag), ITRANSPATH should contain the name
       of the directory that dvng10.tfm resides in.

       The  input  text  may  be in TeX format, or just in direct
       PostScript format.  By default, TeX   format  is  assumed.
       The command line switches are:


       --PP     Overrides  the  default  TeX  input assumption, and
              expects that direct PostScript  output  has  to  be
              produced.

              If  using  the  PostScript  output version, you may
              need to specify the font size to use.  By  default,
              a 30 point size is assumed.  This option may not be
              really necessary, since you can change  font  sizes
              and  types as desired in the input text itself, see
              the sample file flag.ips,  and  the  prologue  file
              itrans.pro,  for  details  regarding changing fonts
              (you must have some PostScript programming  ability
              to do this).

       --77

       --88     Overrides  the  default  TeX  input assumption, and
              expects that direct Text output has to be produced.
              This  can only be used with fonts that support this
              mode, such as Romanized-Sanskrit output  using  the
              CSUtopia  group  of fonts. This allows users to get
              output text that can be transported to a  PC  or  a
              Mac   that  has  the  CSUtopia  Type1  or  TypeType
              installed.  Later on, more Indic Scripts  may  also
              be  supported here, when freeware Type1 or TrueType
              fonts become available.  Use -7 to get 7 bit  ASCII
              output,  and  -8  for 8-bit text output. Both these
              flags produce text that can  be  viewed  using  WWW
              HTML browsers.

       --UU     Assumes  the  output is to be in Unicode UTF-8 for-
              mat.  This is generally  used for HTML  files,  and
              viewed  on browsers that support Unicode, with Uni-
              code fonts.

       --ii _<_i_n_p_u_t _f_i_l_e_n_a_m_e_>
              Use this option to provide a input  file  name,  if
              this option is absent, the input file is assumed to
              be stdin.

       --oo _<_o_u_t_p_u_t _f_i_l_e_n_a_m_e_>
              Use this option to provide a output file  name,  if
              this  option  is absent, the output file is assumed
              to be stdout.

       --vv     Set  verbose  mode,  itrans  prints  out   messages
              regarding  what  it  is doing.  Multiple -v options
              increase  the  amount  of  information  dumped   to
              stderr.   Two  -v's  will  print each input word in
              comments to stdout (or the output file), this makes
              it  easier  to track down errors in the output file
              and relate the output to the input.

       --hh||HH   Help option; prints out a synopsis of  the  command
              line arguments to itrans.

       A  large  number  of sample input documents have been pro-
       vided, in the itrans/doc directory.  Files with names end-
       ing in ..iittxx are TeX input files, and files with names end-
       ing in ..iippss are PostScript input files.  To  print  out  a
       file  named  nneehhrruu..iittxx,, the following commands can be used
       (current directory is assumed to be the itrans/doc  direc-
       tory, and ITRANSPATH environment variable is assumed to be
       set correctly):

       $ itrans -i nehru.itx -o nehru.tex
       $ latex nehru.tex
       $ dvips nehru.dvi | lp

       To print out a file named ffllaagg..iippss,, use the following com-
       mands:

       $ itrans -P -f 25 < flag.ips > flag.ps
       $ cat ../lib/devnac.ps ../lib/itrans.pro flag.ps | lp

       The  above examples assume that the lp command takes in as
       input a PostScript file, and prints  it  on  a  PostScript
       printer.   You may have to use some other print command to
       print out the PostScript files generated, see your  system
       administrator for details.
