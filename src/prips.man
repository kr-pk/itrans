       The command

                             prips hindi.ps

       prints out  the  files  devnac.ps,  itrans.pro,  and  then
       hindi.ps  onto  stdout.   The usual form of usage for this
       command is:
                         prips <filename> | lp

       where lp is assumed to be a  PostScript  capable  printer,
       and  <filename>  is  the name of the file output by iittrraannss
       when run using the  PostScript  interface  (-P  option  of
       itrans).

       pprriippss  currently  is  a  shell file, and must be edited at
       your site so  as  to  pick  up  the  files  devnac.ps  and
       itrans.pro from the correct place.  The variable LIBDIR in
       the file prips should be changed to  reflect  the  correct
       path.

       pprriippss  can  be  also  modified  for  use  with  any  other
       PostScript font,  if  used  by  ITRANS.   Instead  of  the
       devnac.ps  file,  the particular font file should be used.
       prips is a text file, check it out if you need  to  modify
       it to support other languages such as bengali or gujarati.

       prips resides in the src directory (or bin, if  installed)
       of  the  itrans  package.   For  MS-DOS  machines, use the
       prips.bat file --- it will have  to  edited  as  mentioned
       above  (though  it does not have any LIBDIR variable; just
       edit the COPY statement itself.)
