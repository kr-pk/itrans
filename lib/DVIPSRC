# NOT USED as of ITRANS 5.31 and texlive
# use updmap-sys, etc to make system config contain the PSHEADERS
# and psfonts.map
#
# to use this:
# export DVIPSRC=/usr/share/itrans53/lib/DVIPSRC
# assuming a normal install was done.
# This file is not necessary if the INSTALL.unix instructions were followed
# and the TEXPSHEADERS and TEXPSFONTMAPS are updated.
#
# make default resolution 300, makes .ps files smaller!
# D 300
# instead of D, use mode, which causes less confusion. pick a 300dpi mode
#M jetiiisi
# R: use these font sizes if any font size missing - don't, use default list.
# R 300 329 432
#f: run as a filter
#f
#o [filename] put output in given file (no-name -> <fname>.ps, !lpr does !lpr)
o
# H: search for PS header files..(font files, etc) or use TEXPSHEADERS
# I think the : here makes dvips look into standard places first
# H :/usr/share/itrans53/lib:/usr/share/itrans53/lib/fonts
# H /usr/share/itrans53/lib/fonts:
#
# add the following psfonts.map file ...
p +/usr/share/itrans53/lib/itrans.map
# suppress partial loading of fonts (breaks itxbeng and itxguj, atleast in 2001)
