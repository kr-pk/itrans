T<SMALL>E</SMALL>X Interface</A>

<P>
This devanagari font <EM>devnag</EM> is a Metafont font,
developed by Frans Velthuis, and his package is called ``Devanagari for
TeX''.

<P>
The devnag font is in a archive named <TT>devnag</TT> or <TT>devanagari</TT>.
It is available at all CTAN T<SMALL>E</SMALL>X archives
in the languages directory. At the time of writing this document (2001),
it was certainly available at ftp.cdrom.com, ctan.tug.org, and many other sites.
Please use your Internet search tools to locate the CTAN site closest to
you for downloading the devnag archive.

<P>
This font is not bundled with the itrans package, but is available at
many FTP sites, including in the texlive package.

<P>
This ITRANS package make use of Velthuis's Devanagari for TeX package,
version 2.15 (released 2008). This contains a change from the previous
1.6 version - the font family <TT>dvnb</TT> is used instead of <TT>dvng</TT>. This is required
to get the correct <TT>j~n<I>a and</I> GY<I>a</I></TT> consonant variations. 

<P>

<P>
<BR>

<P>
Devnag also has another Metafont file (dvpn10.mf) which generates a
variation of the Devnag font.
If you have Metafont on your system, you may
use it to generate the PK and TFM files for T<SMALL>E</SMALL>X.
This variation was developed by Thomas Ridgeway, and in his words,
it is ``a trivial variation of dvnb10.mf to resemble devanagari 
written with an ordinary writing pen''.
Looks nice.

<P>
Note that the <EM>dvpn10.mf</EM> file alone is insufficient to
generate the T<SMALL>E</SMALL>X font, the complete devnag package is required
to make it usable.
And, you must know enough about Metafont to run it.

<P>

<P><P>
<BR>

<P>
<B>Important:</B> 
itrans does not automatically handle all the ligatures present in the
devnag font.
The Devnag font does contain many three- and four- consonant ligatures, most
of which are not currently supported using <EM>itrans</EM>.
See the section titled ``Limitations'' for more details.

<P>

<H2><A NAME="SECTION00012000000000000000">
Direct Textual Interface - HTML</A>
</H2>

<P>
HTML interface is supported using this font,
Unicode (UTF-8) is supported for this the Devanagari script, but no
Unicode fonts are included with the ITRANS package.

<P>
Since this is a T<SMALL>E</SMALL>X font, this interface cannot be used as is for HTML.
But, Sandeep Sibal, developer of the Jtrans package, has made available a
font named Xdvng, which is derived from the dvng/dvnb fonts, and which allows
use of Xdvng with the direct Text HTML output mode of ITRANS.
See the example files for HTML output in the ITRANS doc directory
(ITRANS/doc/s1html.itx); the
IFM file to use is named <EM>xdvng.ifm</EM>.
The IFM file has been developed by Sandeep Sibal, and the Xdvng font 
(available for multiple platforms) has been
developed by Sandeep Sibal and Arun Gupta
See

for info on Sandeep Sibal's Jtrans package.

Text Interface - Unicode (UTF-8) for Sanskrit, Hindi, and Marathi</A>
</H2>

<P>
IFM file to use is named <EM>udvng.ifm</EM>.

<P>
Unicode (UTF-8) output is supported for this the Devanagari script, but no
Unicode fonts are included with the ITRANS package. There are many
Unicode fonts available on the  Web, and more are being developed
so it should be easy to locate a Unicode font when needed. Not all
Unicode fonts fully support Indian Languages yet.

<P>

<H2><A NAME="SECTION00014000000000000000">
Sanskrit (or Hindi) and Marathi</A>
</H2>

<P>
The IFM file <EM>dvng.ifm</EM> can be used for
Sanskrit, Hindi or Marathi output.

<P>
The marathi form of ra-half is available through the <TT>R</TT>
character and the second LA is at <TT>L</TT> (or <TT>ld</TT>), etc.
The tables (<A HREF="node3.html#ienc">1</A> and <A HREF="node8.html#ienc-velth">7</A>) display
the complete mapping from English to Devanagari
for all the three Indic Scripts.

<P>
A second IFM file is also provided, <EM>dvngfull.ifm</EM>, and is meant to be
used for text that needs to use many archaic consonant conjunct forms.
Use this file only if you really need all the consonant conjuncts; in
most cases a smaller set of consonant conjuncts, as defined by the
dvng.ifm file suffices.
The tables that follow include information on which conjunct glyphs
are available using which IFM file.
dvng.ifm file is the one most commonly used, since this has the ``best''
set of ligatures.
