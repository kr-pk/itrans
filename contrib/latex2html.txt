Using latex2html version:   2K.1beta dated August 2001

This works.

Since ITRANS support is already included in this version of latex2html,
the instructions are very simple:

	First follow all the instructions in the README file in
	latex2html.

	Then, to make the Indic-HTML styles available, link these
	files from Indic-HTML into styles:

	cd ....../latex2html/styles
	ln -s ../Indic-HTML/itrans.perl .

To run:
    latex2html <filename>.itx

so, I run latex2html on the .itx file. See ITRANS/contrib/mkl2h for a
shell script that I used to generate the language specific HTML files at 
http://www.aczoom.com/itrans/

-------------------------------------------------------------------------
[This is the set of instructions from Ross M, with some of my comments]
Avinash Chopde, Mar 1999

Note that making latex2html work is not very easy! It took me along time,
with a lot of help from Ross Moore...

As of April 1999, the latest release of latex2html - 99.1, will work:
[ This is LaTeX2HTML Version 99.1 release (March 30, 1999) ]
correctly, any past release will not work, and any future release
may also have some problems with ITRANS documents.

Latest versions of latex2html could be obtained from:
    http://cdc-server.cdc.informatik.tu-darmstadt.de/~latex2html/
This site is for development only, if it is no longer working, try
a WWW search for more info, or check the mailing-list at:
http://www.xray.mpe.mpg.de/mailing-lists/latex2html/info.html

***********               OLDER RELEASE FIXES:
For latex2html-98.2beta, release of (June 26th, 1998): later versions upto
latex2html-98.2beta8 (September 9th, 1998) will not work correctly,
it is expected that a new version 99.1 after that will probably work.
The latex2html archive contains the latex2html script and the itrans.perl
program.

Even though 98.2b version works reasonably well, it still has some
bugs that need fixing before it can be used with the ITRANS docs.

There are two fixes I had to make:

1)  around line 5369, in function "substitute_newcmd", comment out
the s/(\\\w+)?\#$i/(($1&&$isword)? $1.' ': '').$arg/e ; line, and
replace with the following:
#avinash: 3/8/1999, fix from Ross Moore, to make \kRn (\kern-0.4em) work
#       s/(\\\w+)?\#$i/(($1&&$isword)? $1.' ': '').$arg/e ;
        s/(\\\w+)?\#$i/$1.(($1&&$isword)? ' ': '').$arg/e ;
[above fix is for 98.2b8, don't think it is needed for 98.2beta...]
Also:
replace line around line 4104 (search for "external=") with:
    s/(^|,\s*)external/$external=1;''/ie;

2) in latex2html/texinputs/html.sty, around line 352, comment out the
alternate \excludecomment defn, just use Victor's defn:
%%% avinash: suppress this, since it does not work to trap the & char
%%% that I need for ITRANS .itx files... (3/8/99)
%%\renewcommand{\excludecomment}[1]{\csname newenvironment\endcsname{#1}{\@gobbleenv}{}}

------ Installation Instructions for latex2html 99.1 ------

Since ITRANS support is already included in this version of latex2html,
the instructions are very simple:
	First follow all the instructions in the README file in
	latex2html.

	Then, to make the Indic-HTML styles available, link these
	files from Indic-HTML into styles:

	cd .../latex2html/styles

To run:
    latex2html <filename>.itx
so, I run latex2html on the .itx file. See ITRANS/contrib/mkl2h for a
shell script that I used to generate the language specific HTML files at 
http://www.aczoom.com/itrans/

That's it...

--------------------------------------------------------------------------
Note that there are some problems with latex2html, which require some
changes to the input files:

1) Manually break up any longtables into multiple makeimage
environments.

2) By default, latex2html will create a GIF image of every
#indian...#endindian section. Since this can create hundreds of images
for the user docs in ITRANS/doc/*.itx, I made use of 
\begin{makeimage}
..
\end{makeimage}
to force latex2html to create images of entire tables or subsections of
tables, which results in far fewer number of GIF files.

3) See all the ITRANS/doc/*.itx files for examples of changes made.

From: "Ross Moore  <ross@zeus.mpce.mq.edu.au>" <ross@zeus.mpce.mq.edu.au>

I've bundled-up the necessary files that allow ITRANS
to work with  LaTeX2HTML v98.1p1 .

You can get them from:

http://www-texdev.mpce.mq.edu.au/l2h/indic/ITRANS/l2hitrans.tar.gz

It contains 3 files:

  1.  itrans.sty   package for LaTeX-2e
	(install within the texmf TDS directory structure)

  2.  itrans.perl  package for LaTeX2HTML
	(install within $LATEX2HTMLDIR/styles )

  3.  latex2html
	experimental revised version of v98.1p1
	replaces the script in $LATEX2HTMLDIR

This assumes you already have LaTeX2HTML installed,
in some directory (referred to as $LATEX2HTMLDIR).

***** You need a full installation,
the file in this archive is not sufficient by itself.

***** You'll need to run  install-test  again,
to replace some paths at the beginning of the script.
[Copy this latex2html to the same directory as install-test, and
run install-test again.]


       How to use LaTeX2HTML with ITRANS
       ---------------------------------

You need to have LaTeX-2e  (LaTeX 2.09 is not enough)

Make sure ITRANS is installed  and  
  $ITRANSPATH  is set within the working environment.

Alternatively you can hard-code it into  itrans.perl 
by looking for where  $ENV{ITRANSPATH} is mentioned.

There are 3 processing modes.

Mode 1:  
	.tex  file, already preprocessed by ITRANS

 Start your documents with:
  \documentclass[11pt]{article}    (or whatever)
  \usepackage{itrans}
  ...

Loading itrans.sty  will load  idevn.tex  and  itrnstlg.tex
if they can be found in the LaTeX inputs tree.
(Do *not* try to input these files separately.)

Images will be made of inline portions and paragraphs of 
Indic language text (converted to TeX macros).


Mode 2:
	.itx file,  not yet pre-processed

 Start your documents with:
  \documentclass[11pt]{article}    (or whatever)
  \usepackage[preprocess]{itrans}
  ...

Now LaTeX2HTML will locate the  #hindi ... #endhindi
portions to make an image of inline parts,
or of each paragraph within larger parts.
(All the ITRANS languages are supported, not just #hindi .)

The itrans  preprocessor will be called as part of the
image-generation process.


Mode 3:
	.itx file,  create HTML output using special fonts.
  (only works for  ItxBeng, ItxGuj, Xdvng, romancsx  

 Start your documents with:
  \documentclass[11pt]{article}    (or whatever)
  \usepackage[preprocess,html8]{itrans}
  ...

The itrans  preprocessor will be called for each portion
of input text that needs to be translated.
Other languages will be dealt with, as in Mode 2.

Tell me if you find bugs, or if you extend the capabilities 
of ITRANS to include other languages or other fonts.

As yet  #useshortmarkers  and  #ignoreshortmarkers
are *not* implemented.

Enjoy,
	Ross Moore
