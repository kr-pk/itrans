--------------------------
****** Version 5.34, 10 Apr 2013
    1) Have itrans automatically pass through extended Unicode (non-ASCII) UTF-8 chars
       from the input. There was a problem in that CSX codes like 0o342 (0xE2) for AA end up
       breaking up Unicode double quote (0xE2 0x80 0x9C) and causing invalid UTF-8 output.

    2) Suppress "Note... echoing to output" messages from itrans output, unless -v is provided.
        "Note (around line %d): character [%c] (dec %d) unrecognized by lexer, echoing to output\n"

    IMPORTANT: Windows is no longer supported. Last pre-built version it has is ITRANS 3.2.

****** Version 5.33, 10 Mar 2013
    1) Suppress copyright messages to stdout. This supports use as a filter,
       so only actual conversion is output to stdout or to output file.

****** Version 5.32, 06 Feb 2011, 09 Dec 2012
    1) [06 Feb 2011] Discovered a problem with UTF-8 output for Kannada, Telugu. The
       ukan.ifm etc files need to be processed like Devanagari, i.e,
       C+C+V and not C+V+C-Viraam which is done for TeX output.
    2) [Dec 2012]
       * UTF-8 Roman output for j~n fixed. Needs to use character code 241 in UTF,
       and 164 in ISO-8859-1, or extended ASCII. jnh and gya changed in uroman.ifm.
       * "La" (lda) also changed - now is l-underbar in UTF-8 (but not ISO-8859) output.
       tblall docs updated: http://www.aczoom.com/itrans/html/tblall/node4.html
       though there may be errors in conversion due to invalid Latex2HTML setup.

****** Version 5.31 (executables still 5.30), 01 Dec 2009
    1) This is primarily a packaging change, with some bug fixes in config
       files. No changes in the executable.

    2) dvng: instead of using the dvng font, it now uses dvnb which contains
       the GY j~n character needed.
       The current TeX distribution, texlive, has latest Velthuis Devnag
       package which does not have j~n, and also removes old \char43.
       The "dvnb" font has j~n at 224 and 236. So, updated all tex files
       to refer to dvnb10 instead of dvng10 (though kept names \largedvng, etc
       the same), and change ja-nya and gya in dvng and dvngfull IFM files
       to refer to 224/236.
       Updated files:
       idevn.tex
       webincl.tex
       dvng.ifm
       dvngfull.ifm

       Note that texlive may have an older version of idevn.tex, so
       make sure the itrans version of idevn.tex is picked up first by 
       LaTeX, for example, by adding these lines to appropriate
       environment variables or to /usr/local/texlive/2009/texmf.cnf
       (see file INSTALL.unix)

    3) The web input file webincl.tex is now available in this package
       lib/ directory. It is used by the itrans cgi script, which is
       available in itrans-cgi.zip archive.

    4) Docs
       .ps files removed, now using .pdf files instead.
       .html files regenerated, managed to get latex2html running.
       See doc/README for some details, as well as contrib/mkl2h

****** Version 5.30, 22 July 2001
    1) Added support for Unicode UTF-8 output
    2) Binary pre-built installations created for Linux-i386 and Win32
    3) Created support for "make install" to install itrans on
       a Unix box (Linux, etc).

    ** 10 Dec, 2001
    1) Minor fixes to makefile.gcc, etc - "make install" should now work

    ** 5 Oct, 2002
    1) itrans.h mods for MacOS X/Darwin compilcation, from Shrisha Rao

    ** 12 Aug, 2003
    1) Updated Gurmukhi doc to make it clear the tables have #usecsx on.

    ** 22 Feb, 2003
    1) Updated ubeng.ifm, added Unicode yya (ya-dot)

    ** 29 Jul, 2006
    1) buffer checks in iyacc.y and dflt_mkl.c - handle bad input, too many
    half-consonants in a letter - as in when users send in binary files
    instead of text to the Online Web Interface to ITRANS.
    2) removed: itrans16.exe  - 16-bit Windows exe, for Windows 3.1,
    no longer supported. 32-bit Windows itrans.exe is available.

    ** 28 Apr, 2007
    1) idevn.tex - add % after font definition \normaldvng etc, to
    avoid a space character after every #indian or ##

    ** 26 Mar, 2007
    1) uroman.ifm:
    fixed tmpl-ii should be 0x012B was 0x16B same as tmpl-uu.
    2) udvng.ifm:
    make O be the VOWEL SIGN CANDRA O  (AA + ardha-chandra)
    Only Unicode conversion supports this, for now.

    ** 27 Sep, 2009
    1) Email, Web updates in readme
    2) tlgutx.ifm sa was too like na, created a new tmplC for sa.
    3) The current TeX distribution, texlive, has latest Velthuis Devnag
       package which does not have j~n, and also removes old \char43.
       The "dvnb" font has j~n at 224 and 236. So, updated all tex files
       to refer to dvnb10 instead of dvng10 (though kept names \largedvng, etc
       the same), and change ja-nya and gya in dvng and dvngfull IFM files
       to refer to 224/236.

--------------------------
****** Version 5.22, 18 December 1998 [also March 1999, and Feb 2000]
Minor changes to 5.20
    1) Fixed bug in Telugu processing - code was ignoring explicit IFM
       rules for multiple consonants (C1-C2 : ka-kha, etc).
    2) Added Tikkana.ifm for TrueType telugu font (Potana, Tikkana, etc).
    3) Minor:
       - Added pagenumbering in Devanagari when
         \usepackage[devnag]{itrans} used in input files [NOT WORKING] 
       - xdvng.ifm now has ka-shha rule (== ksha)
       - contrib/latex2html.txt updated, all html docs regenerated,
         many had missing images; beng.itx changes for latex2html [March 1999]
       - HTML output font commands now accept + in SIZE spec, to allow
         #<langfont>=<FONT FACE="xdvng" SIZE="+3">

--------------------------
****** Version 5.20, 16 September 1998
This release contains additions and bug fixes only. All ITRANS 5.1
documents will be correctly handled by this release.
    1) Added additional ITRANS codes:
       RRi == R^i     RRI == R^I
       LLi == L^i     LLI == L^I
       '   == .a      (only when #usecsx is in effect)
    2) Gurmukhi now supported.
       Anshuman Pandey developed the ITRANS support for the
       "Punjabi" Gurmukhi PostScript font.
    3) Bengali: New font from the BWTI package by Abhijit Das (Barda).
       Jaijeet Roychowdhury added support for it in ITRANS, it is a
       TeX Metafont font.
       Added "Y" (yya in the IFM file) for ease of use with Bengali
       Changed:
          f --> Y
       Added "J" (jadot in the IFM file) for ease of use with Bengali
          y, z == J
       Note: both Y and J can be used with any language, not just Bengali.
    4) Added new document: tblall.itx - table that shows ITRANS encoding
       for every language and font supported by ITRANS.
    5) #include=<filename> now searches for filename in all directories
       defined in the environment variable ITRANSPATH
    6) HTML output: added #endfont=<string> and extended #<langfont>, ex:
       #endfont=</FONT>		% this is a global command, for all languages
       ....
       #hindifont=<FONT FACE="Xdvng">	% this is language specific
       now, every #hindi will then print <FONT FACE="Xdvng">
       & any #end<lang> will print </FONT>
    7) xdvng.ifm - : token fixed (AHA), change Itrans to itrans (small i)
       to fix all the *-half rules.
       dvng.ifm - ra-ri, ra-li, etc rules end word spacing fixed.
	  l-underbar (CSX code 215) accepted as L/ld (LDA).
	  Added two three-consonant conjuncts: da-va-ya and da-va-ra
	  Enabled the ka-shha rules (so kSh prints same as the "ksh" special
	  just based on the ifm file - this allowed removal of the special
	  "kSh" rule from the code in ilex.l).
       dvngfull.ifm - added ra-ri, ra-li, da-va-ya, etc rules (copied
       from dvng.ifm)
    8) tamil.mf modified, replaced with Siddharthan Ramachandramurthi's
       version, changed shapes to be slanted.
    9) Added Shree's updates & fixes to wntml.ifm: fixed 5.1 bugs, and
       updated with more rules to allow easier handling of Sanskrit docs
       Changed:
          t --> T
	  dh --> t
       This makes it more in line with Anthony Stone's and other standard
       transliterations.
   10) Updated Velthuis's Devanagari fonts, received from Anshuman Pandey.
   11) Added Ashok Basargekar's chart (Velthuis-like layout) to dvng.itx 
   12) Added j0 option to lib/DVIPSRC to make ItxGuj,ItxBeng,etc fonts work
   13) All LaTeX2.09 *.itx documents changed to LaTeX2e.
   14) Most *.itx documents now available as HTML too (Ross's LaTeX2HTML).
   15) ichar.c bug, causing coredump when ksha appeared in #telugu, fixed.
   16) Fixed Kannada documentation (kantex.itx) - any #<lang> markers can
       now be used with Kannada, no need to restrict usage to #telugu here.
   17) Minor:
       -- LaTeX changes to all tables in all user manual documents
       ITRANS/doc/*.itx; eliminated some large non-useful tables (like
       consonant-vowel forms for all consonants and vowels); added hints
       to make latex2thml work better on all the .itx docs.
       -- Fixed telmode.mf, comment out mode line, to stop mf error messages.
          Fixed similar problem in kanmain.mf for Kannada.
   18) #useshortmarkers is now the default, short markers (##) are always
       on. To turn off, use #ignoreshortmarkers.
   19) 

--------------------------
****** Version 5.10, June 1997
    1) Missing files "psfonts.map" & "FONTS.SCALE" added to the lib directory.
    2) 8.3 filename notation adapted for files telchars?.mf and itxbengrc
       and itxbengre - they are now telchrs?.mf & itxbngrc & itxbngre.
    3) ItxBeng font modified - to display on Win95 Netscape.
    4) Bug in itrans.c with the -P direct PostScript output option fixed.
    5) realloc() call changed to handle problems on SunOS.

****** Version 5.10, May 1997
    1) ITRANS now accepts IFM consonant conjunct definitions of 3 or more
       consonants too! Example:
	CCADD na-dha-ya ;
	CCS na-dha-ya tmplA ;
	CC na-dha-ya-implicit 2 ; PCC 251 0 0 ; PCC 255 0 0 ;
	...

****** Version 5.05, Feb 1996
    1) Added support for Bengali (ItxBeng PostScript Type 1 font)
       TeX, PostScript, Direct Text (HTML, etc) output modes.

    2) Added support for Sandeep Saibal's Xdvng (Type1 & TrueType)
       font, for Direct Text output - mainly HTML. Xdvng is from
       Saibal's Jtrans package.

    3) All devanagari fonts: ra-ri, ra-rii, ra-li, ra-lii modified
       -- all these are now full vowels, with the ra-rafar on top,
       i.e rR^i  ==>  R^i.r, etc

****** Version 5.04, Dec 1996
    1) Complete compatibility with ITRANS 4.04 encoding.
       Just added new codes:
       Added: w (== v), kSh (== ksh), ~N (== for N^), ~n (== for JN),
              dny (== GY), ^r (== .r - half-ra)

    2) ## is now enabled by default. Also, ## can be used to turn on and off
       any language marker -- no longer restricted to #indian.
       A ## that is meant to start Indic Text processing will assume that
       the last seen language marker tag is to be restarted.
       Ex:
       #gujarati 
         .................. 
	 ## [this implies, turn off gujarati]
	 .....
	 ## [this implies turn on gujarati again]
	#endgujarati
	etc..

    3) Added #output= tag. So, no need to provide args like -P or -T to
       ITRANS, the input file itself can tell ITRANS what kind of output
       to produce - "TeX" (is default), or "PostScript", or just plain
       "Text".
       #output=Text or #output=PostScript or #output=TeX

    4) Added support for Gujarati (ItxGuj PostScript Type 1 font)
    5) Added support for Romanized Sanskrit (CSUtopia* PostScript Type1 fonts)
    6) #include=<filename>
       added as a new ITRANS command, this command will behave as if the
       given file name was copied in at that point. Can appear anywhere
       in the document, and can have nested #include commands (to some maximum).
    7) Itrans now has a -T option (Direct Text Output). Currently, this
       can be used to convert any ITRANS text into Romanized-Sanskrit output,
       which can be viewed on the PC/Mac using the TrueType or Type 1
       CSUtopia fonts.
       In later releases, this will be used to produce Gujarati, Bengali
       or any other Indic Script output as long as a freeware Type 1 or
       TrueType font exists for that script. This will allow viewing
       Itrans encoded texts directly in WWW HTML browsers, when such
       browsers start supporting TrueType or Type 1 fonts.
    8) There is no longer any need for separate Marathi IFM files, so
       mdvng.ifm and mdvnc.ifm have been removed from the package.
       The basic devanagari IFM files: dvng.ifm and dvnc.ifm offer 
       both the marathi half-ra (as "R"), and the second LA, LDA (as "L").
    9) TAMIL encoding changed. I had the 5 "n" sounds all incorrect, I think
       the stuff is more correct now! 
		4.x     5.x    Unicode Name
		--      --     ------------
		ng -->  ~N     NGA
		ny -->  ~n     NYA
		N  -->  N      NNA
		n  -->  ^n     NNNA
		n^ -->  n      NA
    10) #endwordvowel=a
       OR
       #endwordvowel=.h
       commands added.
       These are useful for allowing use of the same IFM file for multiple
       langauges where the only difference is how a word (without any
       ending vowel) is to be handled. For Hindi/Marathi, use:
	       #endwordvowel=a
       in your input text, for Sanskrit (to add a viraam at end of words
       without a ending vowel), use:
	       #endwordvowel=.h
       Normally, the IFM file will provide a reasonable default value,
       which is "a" for the scripts similar to Devanagari.
       If left unspecified in the IFM file, the default is ".h".
       These #endwordvowel commands will override the DEFAULTVOWEL
       assignment read from the IFM file.

--------------------------
****** Version 4.02, 15 Dec 1994
****** Version 4.03,  1 Jan 1995
****** Version 4.04, 21 Feb 1995

    This version makes changes that are incompatible with 3.xx or earlier
    ITRANS texts. Markers have changed, but no transliteration codes have
    changed -- so old ITRANS encoded texts will be accepted as is.
    
    1) Support for CSX (Classical Sanskrit Encoding) texts.
       See doc/icsx.itx (or better still, just print out doc/icsx.ps).
    2) All ITRANS commands now begin with # (previously, \ was used, but
       that confuses ITRANS commands with TeX commands).
       Short markers have been changed to ##
       Only one short marker is available, and it acts as a toggle.
       To convert pre-4.0 docs to 4.0, a sed script is provided.
       If you do not have sed on your machine, you will have to manually
       make the modifications to your input files.
    3) Added TeX macro file (lib/idevn.tex) for easier use of Devanagari fonts.
    4) Fixed the hindi ra-faar bug. RA-<cons>-<cons>..<vowel> would not
       be handled correctly in previous releases. So, rdhva, etc input
       printed incorrectly. Fixed this problem, so now rdhva, etc work ok.
    5) Added a sample input file - doc/sample.itx. Beginning (or advanced)
       users should take a look at this small file.
    6) "M" now works like anusvara (".n").

    Ver 4.01:
    1) Added m-overdot (== anusvara) to CSX code.
    2) Fixed bad bug in idevn.tex - \par redefinition in \obeyspaceslines
       would eat up any numerical text at the beginning of a line!
       (Needed a \relax at the end.)
       
    Ver 4.02:
    1) Added | as a command in idevn.tex to print Da.nDaa when using
       Frans's font.
    2) Modified icsx.itx to make it a bit clearer that uppercase characters
       have different meanings than lowercase chars, even in CS/CSX mode.
    3) Added the file csx2i.c to the src/ directory, is a standalone
       filter program to accept CS/CSX input text through stdin, and produce
       ITRANS encoded text on stdout.
       
    Ver 4.03:
    1) Bug fixed: "tryaa" now prints correctly (was printed
       as ta-half, yaa, ra-faar! Should be: ta-ra conjunct, yaa).

    Ver 4.04:
    1) Removed the "aM" ilex.l rule, since "M" itself is recognized as
       anusvara, and so there is no need for "aM" rule. This does not
       matter for devanagari, but for other languages, which do not have
       aM rules in the .ifm files, but do have anusvara, this works out
       much better.
    2) TeX output now suppress { } characters, and prints them as char codes
       in the .tex output files, since { and } are TeX characters used
       for defining scope and having ITRANS print out { } makes it very
       confusing to search for matching braces in .tex files.
    3) DOS executable now made with the latest flex (2.4.7), supposed
       to fix some 8-bit input bugs.
    4) Added sample makefiles for Linux (gcc/flex), Sun, SGI, etc.
    
****** Version 3.00, 21 June 1992
****** Version 3.01, 17 July 1992
****** Version 3.02, 7 August 1992
****** Version 3.10, 11 September 1992
****** Version 3.11, 5 October 1992
****** Version 3.12, 15 October 1992
****** Version 3.20, 10 December 1992
    1) Changed Ri, RI, Li, and LI to R^i, R^I, L^i, and L^I, respectively.
       These vowels are not used much anyway, and I needed "R" for
       a consonant (telugu, tamil, and bengali).
       Changed chandra-bindu to .N (was .C)
       Changed "ng" to "N^", changed "jn" to "JN". These are minimally
       used consonants, but caused problems for na-ga, and ja-na ligatures.
    2) All words must end in vowels - if a word has a consonant at the end
       without a vowel, it will be assumed that the "a" vowel is present.
       Thus, in hindi: instead of writing "hama", just "ham" is sufficient.
       This was done to increase readability. To get a viraam at the end
       of a word, use ".h" (without "a"), ex: "ham.h".
       This mechanism is activated for devanagari and bengali only.
    3) Added support for the the telugu font from the TeluguTeX package
    4) Removed support for the bit-mapped bengali font - BANGLA-V1.1
    5) Added support for the bit-mapped bengali font - SGAON
       This is originally a HP SoftFont, and can be converted to TeX PK 
       format, and to PostScript. Thus, it can be used with both TeX and
       PostScript.
    6) Devnac PostScript font: added the ligatures sha-ba, sha-va, sha-cha
    7) split up code in ichar.c to different files handling each indian
       language.
    8) added short marker symbols (!< and >!) to delimit indian lang texts
	(turned off by default, use command \useshortmarkers to enable).
    9) added support for digits (0..9) in the IFM file format.
    10) Default IFM file (dvnc.ifm) is not loaded  on startup, it will
       be loaded only if necessary --- so tamil only users will see
       faster startup times (as will telugu, bengali, etc users).
    11) Added the marathi la - (use mdvnc.ifm to get this).
       Changed the "gy" consonant to "GY" - to reduce conflict with
       the ga-ya consonant conjunct.
       Modified the dda-ya ligature.
       Improved the da-dha ligature.
       Many of the above changes/bug fixes to the devnac font have been made
       at the suggestion of Muduhakar Deshpande, I would like to thank him
       for his input.
    12) IFM file format has changed!

****** Version 2.11, 30 November 1991
    1) Minor changes, mainly break up package into two parts:
       itrns211 and itrnsps, where itrsps contains the printer
       ready postscript documentation. (ZIP or ZOO format archives.))
       This is in anticipation of downloading to IBM-PC archives, such
       as SIMTEL, etc.
    2) Fixed bug to allow \kern command in PostScript mode too..

****** Version 2.10, 14 October 1991
    0) Major features: IFM file added for Frans Velthuis's devanagari
       font (it is called Devnag);
       lots of new ligatures added to the Devnac PostScript font.
       Ligatures can now be inhibited by using the characters {}
       between two consonants in the input text.
       All ra-<consonants> can now be printed using the hindi form
       (before 2.1 these ligatures were not automatically handled,
        users had to use the special .r to get what they needed.
        From 2.1, the correct form will be used.)
       Marathi users can use alternate IFM files, which use the
       marathi form of ra-half.
    1) A few codenames (internal IFM file format data) changed to
       better reflect the actual character represented.
       This does mean that all pre 2.1 release itrans IFM files are now
       obsolete and incompatible with this and future releases.
       Also made a change in the way PCC .. dx dy works, for details
       see the file tech.tex.
    2) Finally have a better understanding of the archiac vowels (Ri, RI, Li
       and LI). Therefore the old naming scheme (RI RU LI RU) thrown out.
       RI in the old scheme is Ri in release 2.1
       RU in the old scheme is RI in release 2.1
       LI in the old scheme is Li in release 2.1
       LU in the old scheme is LI in release 2.1
       The Devnac font only had the Ri character, it was called
       RU earlier (pre 2.1).
       The Devnag font (Frans Velthuis's) uses all four of the above vowels.

****** Version 2.0, 26 August 1991
    0) Thanks to the following persons for many of the bug fixes and
	suggestions: Samir Agarwal, Madhu Deshpande, Gary Thrapp,
	Vick Khera, and many others.

    1) With the help of Sriram Tyagarajan, added support for Tamil.
       Uses the Washington Tamil font, it was created by the Humanities and
       Arts Computing Center of the University of Washington, USA.

    2) Because of 1, and other changes to support multi-languages,
       new keywords have been introduced:
       \indianifm=xxxxxxx   %% set the current IFM file
       There is the concept of a current IFM font file, which contains
       the font data used to construct indian language characters.
       All \marathi or \hindi or \tamil do is to mark the beginning of
       the transliterated text, they do not load in any IFM files, all
       loading must be done thru the \indianifm command.
       \indianfont=yyyyyyy %% command that will printed at \hindi
       See idoc.itex for more info.

       (Old documents with \marathi etc will still work since the default
	IFM file loaded in is devnac.ifm --- the hindi/marathi font
	metric file.)

    3) Changed file extension .itex to .itx, and changed name of file
       devnac.text to devnac.ps
       Lots of other changes, see idoc.itx the user's manual.

    4) added support for MSDOS machines (this version and onwards will
       be developed on the PC---a 80386 machine).
    5) Corrected the ifm definitions for big i, dha-ya ligature, etc
       in the devnac.ifm file.
    6) -I ./xxx.ifm would not work, it would still search for the
       file xxx.ifm in the ITRANSPATH.
       Fixed so that now it realizes that ./xxx.ifm is a full path
       name and  does not look for in the ITRANSPATH.
    7) Changed variable name "inline" to "line_in", some compilers
       did not like the word "inline" (shades of C++...) [font.c]

--------------------------
****** Version 1.01, 11 June 1991

    Most of these bugs came about to support non-ansi systems..

    1)  stdlib.h is missing on many systems, so removed its
	inclusion from itrans.h (instead, added the declaration
	for getenv() - the only thing needed from stdlib.h).

    2)  sprintf() works differently on non-ansi-C machines - instead of
	returning number of characters printed, it simply returns a
	pointer to the string!
	So, changed itotex.c and itops.c to specifically use strlen()
	instead of relying on sprintf().
	Thanks to Dinesh Dattatraya Gaitonde (CMU) for catching this.

    3) Bug in function font.c::S_ccadd() - return TRUE; missing, added.

    4) Specifically define the macro YYDEBUG so as to include the
       integer yydebug in iyacc.c

    5) YFLAGS was missing from the Makefile, added it.
