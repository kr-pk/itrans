----- Navigating the complexities of ITRANS:
 Beginning users: Consult these files: idoc.itx and other *.itx files in the
 doc/ directory, and if you have to deal with installation issues, also
 check out INSTALL.unix or INSTALL.pc in the top directory.

Also, check out the ITRANS home page for more info and links to the
Online ITRANS interface and other e-mail tools that make using ITRANS
much easier, no installation required:
